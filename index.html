His long blond hair and distinctive goatee have become instantly identifiable with his brand, Virgin, which consists of more than 100 companies worldwide.The

                <b>ASK</b>:&nbsp;You are a big advocate of philanthropy and you use your wealth to do work which helps many of the world's poorest people. But do you see the rising inequality in our society as a problem? If so, can we rely on the generosity
                of the super-rich, or should other actions be taken to help close that gap? If the latter, what would your solution be?
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>BRANSON</b>:&nbsp;From my very first day as an entrepreneur, I've felt the only mission worth pursuing in business is to make people's lives better. An important priority for me is a business must get their own house in order. Be or
                become an agent of positive change in your own enterprise and adopt responsible practices to eliminate the risks that often lie at the root of inequality and poverty.
                <br>Rob Kim / GettyThat's why I started Student Magazine at the height of the Vietnam War, to give a voice to my generation who were against the war. It's also why we've been disrupting the airline business for more than 30 years, and
                why we continue to bring change to many other industries, from mobile communications to hotels and, soon, space travel.We must also continue to push ourselves forward to improve lives for people across the planet and I believe business
                can be a driving force for social, environmental and economic benefit. We need to find real world solutions which benefit everyone. I've been very passionate about renewable energy for many years, particularly solar energy and its capacity
                to bring abundant clean, sustainable energy to millions around the globe.One example of this is M-Kopa, a company I have recently invested in. M-Kopa is a pay-as-you-go solar energy provider to off-grid homes across East Africa. The company
                is looking to improve people's access to clean energy and hopes to have their solar systems in more than one million households by the end of 2017.But this is about much more than an investment in a good business idea or a means of reducing
                carbon emissions. In many African countries, where nearly 600 million people still lack electricity, clean energy access often means the difference between prosperity and poverty, between women's empowerment and continued inequality, between
                education and illiteracy. It means having the choices and opportunities that many of us in the West have come to take for granted.
